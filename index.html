    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>My name is Michael and I am from South Florida, but currently living in Oakland, CA. I attended Miami Dade College for 2 years and decided that I wanted to go into the tech world, which is how I ended up at Code Fellows. My previous experience was mainly in the automotive industry, where I repaired motorcycles and worked on cars as well.</p>
